# Piano Pal
The goal of this project is to help beginners learning about reading a sheet music and playing it.
You chose your training program (eg the C major scale), and it displays notes that you have to play, it detects when you play it using your microphone and the session continues. Using the microphone it detects if you play the right note and the session continues.

**It does not handle polyphonic detection.**

# comment about the code
First time I try to rely more on AI than just line auto complete, to see if it could improve my efficiency.
It was a messy, and I was surprised by how different the solutions where based on what AI I used, but it was pretty much all hot garbage the more I was using it.
I learned that you better be very specific and split responsability yourself, because making the project grow becomes very quickly a nightmare if you don't.
